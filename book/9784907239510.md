  『若者から若者への手紙 1945←2015』(ころから)を完全英訳!


  Originally published Japanese, 1945←2015: Reflections on Stolen Youth is now
  available in English. Fifteen Japanese youth of 1945 share their stories and
  fifteen modern-day young people write letters to them in thirty pleas for
  peace that span seven decades. The war survivors were innocent children,
  students, soldiers, and nurses. They lived on mainland Japan and its islands,
  the South Pacific, Korea, and China―and all were forced to take on adult roles
  far beyond their years. This book bears witness to the countless ways war
  alters forever the lives of everyone involved―even survivors who live well
  into old age.
