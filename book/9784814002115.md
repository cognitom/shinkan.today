description: >-
  Throughout twenty-seven years of military occupation, U.S. public affairs
  activities aimed to persuade the local Okinawan public that the U.S.
  administration of Okinawa should be maintained.

  The U.S. maintains military bases around the globe, while advocating
  democratic ideals, including freedom of the press. Yet, while declaring the
  occupation of Okinawa necessary for the defence of democracy, the U.S.
  military administration vigorously repressed freedoms of speech, assembly, the
  media and self-determination. This landmark study explores and uncovers the
  labyrinthine manipulations and mechanisms established to continue to defend
  the hard deployment of military forces through the soft power techniques of
  public relations.
