description: >-
  A Maritime History of East Asia takes the reader on a fascinating journey
  through the history of a region from the perspective of the interactions that
  occurred on and were facilitated by the sea. The book is divided into three
  parts that each focus on a different hundred-year period between 1250 and
  1800, characterized by ‘openness’, ‘competition’ and ‘compartmentalization’
  respectively. The chapters in each part examine the people, goods and
  information, that flowed across the seas of the East Asian maritime world,
  facilitating cultural exchange and hybridity. The intricate and often fraught
  relations between China, Japan and Korea feature throughout, as well as those
  between these polities and the waves of outsiders that sought to trade with
  them and to conquer them. Regional diplomacy, ship-building technology,
  weaponry, Wokou pirate bands, the fates of castaways and the development of
  international trade networks are just some of the topics that paint a vivid
  picture of the interconnected world of the East Asian maritime region during
  this period.
